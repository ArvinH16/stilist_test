## How Image Enhancement Works

1. **Product Link Extraction**: The application extracts product links from search results
2. **Firecrawl Scraping**: Each product page is scraped using Firecrawl to get clean markdown content with images
3. **AI Selection**: Llama AI analyzes the scraped content and selects the best product image based on:
   - Relevance to the product
   - Image size and quality
   - Position in the content
4. **Image Replacement**: The selected high-quality images replace the original lower-quality images
5. **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced images are marked with badges and visual indicators

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing**: Images are enhanced in batches of 3 to respect API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to original images if enhancement fails
- **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during the enhancement process
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between API calls to prevent overwhelming services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure all API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
2. **Network Issues**: Check internet connection and API service status
3. **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter rate limits, wait a few minutes before retrying
4. **Image Loading**: Some enhanced images may take time to load due to external sources

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, check the browser console and server logs for detailed information about the enhancement process.
