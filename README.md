# Product Search App with Intelligent Image Processing

A smart product search application that uses intelligent batch processing to find high-quality product images efficiently.

## Features

- üîç **Product Search**: Search for products across multiple platforms
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- üõí **Product Details**: View product information including prices, ratings, and availability
- üÜï **Image Enhancement**: AI-powered image quality enhancement using Firecrawl and Llama API
- ‚ö° **Real-time Results**: Fast and reliable product search results

## üöÄ New Features: Intelligent Batch Processing

### What's New?
- **Smart Quality Assessment**: Each product image gets a quality score (0-75) based on multiple factors
- **Adaptive Batch Processing**: Dynamically adjusts processing strategy based on success rates
- **Target-Based Processing**: Stops when quality targets are achieved or continues intelligently
- **Enhanced UI**: Visual quality indicators, ranking badges, and detailed processing feedback

### How It Works

#### 1. Quality Scoring System
Products are scored based on:
- **Better Image Found** (+30 points): Successfully found improved image
- **High Resolution Indicators** (+20 points): URLs containing '1200', '800', 'large', 'xl'  
- **Professional Hosting** (+15 points): CDN, assets, or media hosting
- **Good Image Format** (+10 points): .jpg, .jpeg, .png formats
- **Good Original Image** (+15 points): Not encrypted Google thumbnail

#### 2. Intelligent Batch Processing
- **Starts with 2 products** for initial assessment
- **Adapts batch size** based on success rates:
  - Good success (‚â•50%): Continue with batch size 2
  - Poor success (<25%): Increase to batch size 3 for faster discovery
  - Moderate success: Maintain current approach
- **Target Achievement**: Stops when target number of high-quality images found
- **Max Limit Protection**: Won't process more than specified maximum products

#### 3. Visual Quality Indicators
- **üü¢ High Quality (50+ score)**: Green border, professional image found
- **üü° Improved (any score)**: Orange border, image was enhanced
- **üî¥ Basic**: Red indicator, original image used
- **Ranking badges**: Shows processing order (#1, #2, etc.)
- **Quality reasons**: Hover to see why an image got its score

## How Image Enhancement Works

1. **Product Link Extraction**: The application extracts product links from search results
2. **Firecrawl Scraping**: Each product page is scraped using Firecrawl to get clean markdown content with images
3. **AI Selection**: Llama AI analyzes the scraped content and selects the best product image based on:
   - Relevance to the product
   - Image size and quality
   - Position in the content
4. **Image Replacement**: The selected high-quality images replace the original lower-quality images
5. **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced images are marked with badges and visual indicators

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing**: Images are enhanced in batches of 3 to respect API rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to original images if enhancement fails
- **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during the enhancement process
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between API calls to prevent overwhelming services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure all API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
2. **Network Issues**: Check internet connection and API service status
3. **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter rate limits, wait a few minutes before retrying
4. **Image Loading**: Some enhanced images may take time to load due to external sources

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, check the browser console and server logs for detailed information about the enhancement process.
